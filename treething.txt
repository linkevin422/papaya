----solution prompt-----

We work one step at a time, no skipping ahead.

At each step, you show me the exact SQL or code to run.

I will paste back the raw output, and you validate it.

We only move forward once the current step is fully correct.

The goal is to trace the bug layer by layer (data → view → totals → UI), isolating where it goes wrong and fixing it there.
